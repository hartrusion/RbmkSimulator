# Mnemonic Schematics

Mnemonic displays are inspired by the original displays found in the control 
rooms. They are very simplified (as the whole simulator is a simplification).

Those svg files in this directory are used to generate the pngs used as icon
(background) in the application. They were drawn using Inkscape.

The Java Panel uses static background images which are generated from the svg
files in this directory. Valves and pumps are generated by drawing onto the 
GUI with AWT commands directly.

To modify or update mnemonics, the SVG can be modified with the hidden elements 
layer visible. Those help to position the JComponent elements in GUI builder 
exactly. The svg is exported as png and placed in same directory as the 
mnemonic panel classes. After elements are positioned, the png can be replaced
with a new export.
