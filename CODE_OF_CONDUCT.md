# Code of Conduct

Every person who participates in this project (issues, pull requests, 
discussions and so on) must acknowledge, respect and support the **Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights** which was declared on 10 December 1948.

If you're not familiar with this declaration, please take some time and read 
it, it only takes a few minutes.

Contributions of any form which directly or indirectly try to undermine human 
rights will not be tolerated and removed. This includes:
* Spreading false information or narratives with clear intentions that do not 
comply with the universal declaration of human rights.
* Any justification of the war against Ukraine.
* Expressions that justify, advocate, or glorify violence or other violations 
of human rights.
* Supporting organisations or governments which actively deny human rights
* **Any** form of intentional discrimination.

Thoughtful, critical discussions that present different viewpoints and 
perspectives are welcomed. It is encouraged to question the way things are and 
present alternative ways and solutions. It is likely to happen that technical
details will be discussed with emotions and disagreements. 

I have chosen to put this up as a code of conduct because I strongly believe 
that this declaration is fundamental for a peaceful coexistence.
