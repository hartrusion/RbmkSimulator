# Code of Conduct

Every person who participates in this project (issues, pull requests, 
discussions and so on) must acknowledge, respect and support the **Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights** which was declared on 10 December 1948.

If you're not familiar with this declaration, please take some time and read 
it, it only takes a few minutes.

Thoughtful, critical discussions that present different viewpoints and 
perspectives are welcomed, provided they are conducted respectfully and do not 
promote or endorse human rights violations. Constructive debate that questions 
assumptions and explores different solutions is encouraged.

Contributions of any form which directly or indirectly try to undermine human 
rights will not be tolerated and removed. This includes:
* Spreading false information or narratives with clear intentions that do not 
comply with the universal declaration of human rights.
* Any justification of the war against Ukraine.
* Expressions that justify, advocate, or glorify violence or other violations 
of human rights.
* **Any** form of intentional discrimination.

I have chosen to put this up as a code of conduct because I strongly believe 
that this declaration is fundamental for a peaceful coexistence.
